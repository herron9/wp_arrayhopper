# wp_arrayhopper
Find the optimal number of hops to jump out of   the array (or if it's possible at all). You start at index 0. From each position, you are allowed to hop however many positions right that correspond with the value in the index. So, if you are at index 2 and the value at index 2 is 3, you could jump to index 3, 4, or 5.
